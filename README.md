Started with a pull from [mern-starter](https://github.com/Hashnode/mern-starter).

### Changes from mern Starter

- Pulled out files into their parent directory when there was like only one file in the dir with the same name of the dir
- Removed the cross-env lib in package.json. Its a thing only for windows.
- Added sass loaders for webpack: npm install sass-loader node-sass --save-dev

### Todo Short

- Handle the currentFilteredEmail through the url instead of state.
- Load images in email previews
- Save the compilation title and subtitle separately to populate the cover and title page with the same data
- Generate the finalized pdf
- Fix the pdfs for the title page and message page. There is an extra blank page at the bottom.

### Todo Long

- Make the date picker more intuitive. Like make sure any incomplete end date settings jump to the end of the given data. Like if only the year. go to the end of the year. If only year and month go to the end of the month. But keep the start date stuff to go to the beginning of the given data.
- Sanitize email body text before save.
- Reconnect the socket after login, registration, and logout.
